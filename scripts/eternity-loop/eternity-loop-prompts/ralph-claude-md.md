# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Stay on the current branch. Do NOT create, switch, or check out any branches.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update CLAUDE.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`. When doing UI-related things and testing in browser or simulator tasks take screenshots of the results (one or max two per modified screen) and reference them in progress.txt

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- References to screenshots taken (e.g. "See screenshot: progress-screenshots/story-id.png") with a brief description of what the screenshot shows
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update CLAUDE.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby CLAUDE.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md** - Look for CLAUDE.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Do NOT switch branches - stay on the current branch at all times
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
- Never commit ralph files
